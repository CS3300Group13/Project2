    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
    <p>Food waste is a pervasive problem affecting households worldwide, with approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption going to waste. 
        This alarming statistic prompted us to envision a platform that leverages technology to combat food wastage at its roots. Our web app allows users to catalog 
        the contents of their kitchen, transforming their surplus ingredients into delectable recipes and encouraging a more mindful approach to consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond mitigating food waste, our platform integrates social media features, fostering a vibrant community of like-minded individuals passionate about 
        sustainable living and culinary exploration. Users can connect, share, and inspire one another by showcasing the inventive recipes they create from their available 
        ingredients. This social aspect not only strengthens the collective commitment to reducing waste but also transforms cooking into a shared experience that transcends 
        geographical boundaries.

        As far as management, we each volunteered to implement different part of the project and checked in regularly with each other to make sure we were on track or that no
        was blocked from achieving their goal!  This relaxed management style was perfect for this project because of it's relatively small size and the great communication 
        skills our team has demonstrated all year.

    <h1>Software Technologies</h1>
    <p>For this project, our group decided to use a Django backend, with a Bootstrap frontend.
        We believed that this would be the best way to create a web application that would be
        easy to use and look good. We also decided to use a SQLite database, as it is the built
        in database for Django, and we believed that it would be the easiest to use. We also
        decided to use Python as our primary programming language. There are a few uses of 
        Javascript for HTML formatting, but the majority of the code is in Python.</p>

        <p>For the Login and Registration pages, we used the built in Django authentication system,
        as it is a simple way to create this feature.</p>

        <p>For image processing, we use Pillow. This is an open source library that is used for many
        different apps worldwide.</p>

        <p>To create each page, we used Django's App builder functionality, which creates a skeleton
        for each page. We sectioned these apps into these categories: Feed, Pantry, Recipes, Users,
        and the main app that references these apps.</p>

        <p>For the GPT Integration for the Recipe Generator, we used OpenAI's GPT3.5 API to generate
        recipes. We used the food items that users enter in to their pantry, and then aggregate them
        into a specially formatted list to make it easier for GPT to read. We then take the output,
        parse it through a JSON parsing algorithm, and then display the recipe with the title and
        steps on the page.</p>

        <p>Using these technologies, we built the app that you see on this github today. There are many
        other ways to go about building a similar website, but we believed that this was the best
        way to go about it.
