    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
    <p>Food waste is a pervasive problem affecting households worldwide, with approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption going to waste. 
        This alarming statistic prompted us to envision a platform that leverages technology to combat food wastage at its roots. Our web app allows users to catalog 
        the contents of their kitchen, transforming their surplus ingredients into delectable recipes and encouraging a more mindful approach to consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond mitigating food waste, our platform integrates social media features, fostering a vibrant community of like-minded individuals passionate about 
        sustainable living and culinary exploration. Users can connect, share, and inspire one another by showcasing the inventive recipes they create from their available 
        ingredients. This social aspect not only strengthens the collective commitment to reducing waste but also transforms cooking into a shared experience that transcends 
        geographical boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
        As far as management, we each volunteered to implement different part of the project and checked in regularly with each other to make sure we were on track or that no
        was blocked from achieving their goal!  This relaxed management style was perfect for this project because of it's relatively small size and the great communication 
        skills our team has demonstrated all year.

    <h1>Literature Review:</h1>
    <p>There is an increasing need for pantry organization with how much food people store in their homes these days.
        One of our functions in PantryPal is to do just that. The article "Current Use and Demand for Digital Tools to
        Enhance Food Pantry Management: Findings from a Nationwide Survey" explains this exact need which can be found at
        https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19320248.2023.2228728. Another article "Cloud Firestore Inventory
        Solution at a University Food Pantry" describes how helpful digital organization and checking of univeristy pantries
        can help them know when and what foods to restock so they are never out. The article can be found at
        https://www.proquest.com/docview/2640242293?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true</p>
    <p>
        Another accomplishment of our website is to generate recipes that use these ingredients people have
        to reduce waste from unused ingredients which is a problem that has been tackled before by
        https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cseng_senior/211/, which is a senior project by students at Santa Clara
        University. What makes our website different is that we implemented a social media aspect to it which allows
        users to follow each other to see what recipes others are making. This makes the website more fun to use
        as well as collaborative to find recipes from other people and not just our app generated ones.

    <h1>Software Technologies</h1>
    <p>For this project, our group decided to use a Django backend, with a Bootstrap frontend.
        We believed that this would be the best way to create a web application that would be
        easy to use and look good. We also decided to use a SQLite database, as it is the built
        in database for Django, and we believed that it would be the easiest to use. We also
        decided to use Python as our primary programming language. There are a few uses of 
        Javascript for HTML formatting, but the majority of the code is in Python.</p>

        <p>For the Login and Registration pages, we used the built in Django authentication system,
        as it is a simple way to create this feature.</p>

        <p>For image processing, we use Pillow. This is an open source library that is used for many
        different apps worldwide.</p>

        <p>To create each page, we used Django's App builder functionality, which creates a skeleton
        for each page. We sectioned these apps into these categories: Feed, Pantry, Recipes, Users,
        and the main app that references these apps.</p>

        <p>For the GPT Integration for the Recipe Generator, we used OpenAI's GPT3.5 API to generate
        recipes. We used the food items that users enter in to their pantry, and then aggregate them
        into a specially formatted list to make it easier for GPT to read. We then take the output,
        parse it through a JSON parsing algorithm, and then display the recipe with the title and
        steps on the page.</p>

        <p>Using these technologies, we built the app that you see on this github today. There are many
        other ways to go about building a similar website, but we believed that this was the best
        way to go about it.

    <p>
        Our design decisions were to keep the different pages on the website to be handled by their own specific classes
        because that made the most sense for organization purposes. We also needed to use the GPT 3.5 api outside service
        because it made the most sense for recipe generation, we just had to formulate the input in a highly organized
        and structured way so that the output was what we wanted. We also needed to use GCP because that was how we hosted
        the website and stored the database of user information. This worked well for users to interact with each other
        so they can see their friends' posts.

    <h1>Testing:</h1>
    <p>Our testing strategy utilized both black box and white box testing. Most of our black box testing was regression
        testing. Meaning, each time we implemented a new feature we would test each of our previously implemented features
        to ensure they still worked. For example, when we changed the model of the pantry item to allow for better recipe
        generation we ensured that items were still able to be added and deleted correctly. The first time this test was
        run we realized we had instances of pantry items based on different models causing an error. To fix this we deleted
        our database and regenerated it. After running the test again we were able to add and delete items appropriately,
        so we continued our development.</p>
    <p>
        We also tested each feature thoroughly using acceptability testing to make sure all
        features worked the way we intended. An example of this was when we implemented the following page we tested to make
        sure following another user added them to the following list and unfollowing the user added them to the unfollowing
        list. The first time we tested this we noticed that the unfollowing list did not update properly when a previously
        unfollowed user was followed. This made us go back and refactor the feature. After fixing it we re-did the test,
        and it passed allowing us to continue on to other features.
        </p>
    <p>Our whitebox testing was mostly done through unit testing
        using Django TestCase. These tests were focused on ensuring the models we designed for each of the components were
        functional and effective. For example, one of our unit tests tested removing a follower from another user's following
        list. This test checked to make sure our functions were acting on the correct instances of a model. This test passed
        giving us certainty that changes made to models on one page of the app were made globally, not just to a local copy
        of the model.
        </p>
    <p>Testing, encompassing black box regression and white box unit testing, ensured the reliability of
        our application by identifying and resolving issues at both functional and structural levels, ultimately ensuring
        a thorough development process and delivering a high-quality final product. The testing approach provided confidence
        in implementing new features, addressing challenges, and refining the application.
