    <h1>Literature Review:</h1>
    <p>There is an increasing need for pantry organization with how much food people store in their homes these days.
        One of our functions in PantryPal is to do just that. The article "Current Use and Demand for Digital Tools to
        Enhance Food Pantry Management: Findings from a Nationwide Survey" explains this exact need which can be found at
        https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19320248.2023.2228728. Another article "Cloud Firestore Inventory
        Solution at a University Food Pantry" describes how helpful digital organization and checking of univeristy pantries
        can help them know when and what foods to restock so they are never out. The article can be found at
        https://www.proquest.com/docview/2640242293?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true</p>
    <p>
        Another accomplishment of our website is to generate recipes that use these ingredients people have
        to reduce waste from unused ingredients which is a problem that has been tackled before by
        https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cseng_senior/211/, which is a senior project by students at Santa Clara
        University. What makes our website different is that we implemented a social media aspect to it which allows
        users to follow each other to see what recipes others are making. This makes the website more fun to use
        as well as collaborative to find recipes from other people and not just our app generated ones.

    <h1>Software Technologies</h1>
    <p>For this project, our group decided to use a Django backend, with a Bootstrap frontend.
        We believed that this would be the best way to create a web application that would be
        easy to use and look good. We also decided to use a SQLite database, as it is the built
        in database for Django, and we believed that it would be the easiest to use. We also
        decided to use Python as our primary programming language. There are a few uses of 
        Javascript for HTML formatting, but the majority of the code is in Python.</p>

        <p>For the Login and Registration pages, we used the built in Django authentication system,
        as it is a simple way to create this feature.</p>

        <p>For image processing, we use Pillow. This is an open source library that is used for many
        different apps worldwide.</p>

        <p>To create each page, we used Django's App builder functionality, which creates a skeleton
        for each page. We sectioned these apps into these categories: Feed, Pantry, Recipes, Users,
        and the main app that references these apps.</p>

        <p>For the GPT Integration for the Recipe Generator, we used OpenAI's GPT3.5 API to generate
        recipes. We used the food items that users enter in to their pantry, and then aggregate them
        into a specially formatted list to make it easier for GPT to read. We then take the output,
        parse it through a JSON parsing algorithm, and then display the recipe with the title and
        steps on the page.</p>

        <p>Using these technologies, we built the app that you see on this github today. There are many
        other ways to go about building a similar website, but we believed that this was the best
        way to go about it.

    <p>
        Our design decisions were to keep the different pages on the website to be handled by their own specific classes
        because that made the most sense for organization purposes. We also needed to use the GPT 3.5 api outside service
        because it made the most sense for recipe generation, we just had to formulate the input in a highly organized
        and structured way so that the output was what we wanted. We also needed to use GCP because that was how we hosted
        the website and stored the database of user information. This worked well for users to interact with each other
        so they can see their friends' posts.
