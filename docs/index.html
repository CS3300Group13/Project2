    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
    <p>Food waste is a pervasive problem affecting households worldwide, with approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption going to waste. 
        This alarming statistic prompted us to envision a platform that leverages technology to combat food wastage at its roots. Our web app allows users to catalog 
        the contents of their kitchen, transforming their surplus ingredients into delectable recipes and encouraging a more mindful approach to consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond mitigating food waste, our platform integrates social media features, fostering a vibrant community of like-minded individuals passionate about 
        sustainable living and culinary exploration. Users can connect, share, and inspire one another by showcasing the inventive recipes they create from their available 
        ingredients. This social aspect not only strengthens the collective commitment to reducing waste but also transforms cooking into a shared experience that transcends 
        geographical boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
        As far as management, we each volunteered to implement different part of the project and checked in regularly with each other to make sure we were on track or that no
        was blocked from achieving their goal!  This relaxed management style was perfect for this project because of it's relatively small size and the great communication 
        skills our team has demonstrated all year.
