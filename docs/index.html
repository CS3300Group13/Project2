    <p>For this project, our group decided to use a Django backend, with a Bootstrap frontend.
        We believed that this would be the best way to create a web application that would be
        easy to use and look good. We also decided to use a SQLite database, as it is the built
        in database for Django, and we believed that it would be the easiest to use. We also
        decided to use Python as our primary programming language. There are a few uses of 
        Javascript for HTML formatting, but the majority of the code is in Python.</p>

        <p>For the Login and Registration pages, we used the built in Django authentication system,
        as it is a simple way to create this feature.</p>

        <p>For image processing, we use Pillow. This is an open source library that is used for many
        different apps worldwide.</p>

        <p>To create each page, we used Django's App builder functionality, which creates a skeleton
        for each page. We sectioned these apps into these categories: Feed, Pantry, Recipes, Users,
        and the main app that references these apps.</p>

        <p>For the GPT Integration for the Recipe Generator, we used OpenAI's GPT3.5 API to generate
        recipes. We used the food items that users enter in to their pantry, and then aggregate them
        into a specially formatted list to make it easier for GPT to read. We then take the output,
        parse it through a JSON parsing algorithm, and then display the recipe with the title and
        steps on the page.</p>

        <p>Using these technologies, we built the app that you see on this github today. There are many
        other ways to go about building a similar website, but we believed that this was the best
        way to go about it.
